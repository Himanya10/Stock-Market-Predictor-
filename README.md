# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data.  
It processes and scales stock market data, trains a deep learning model, and visualizes both actual and predicted values.  
The notebook also demonstrates forecasts for future timeframes (next day, week, month, and year).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses stock market time-series data.
- Normalizes and scales data for neural network training.
- Builds and trains an **LSTM model** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluates model performance on test data.
- Predicts stock prices for:
  - Next **day**
  - Next **week**
  - Next **month**
  - Next **year**
- Visualizes training loss and prediction accuracy.
